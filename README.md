# 🚀 Dash Application Project  
A structured, intermediate-level project where I built, improved, and tested a complete Dash application—covering everything from environment setup to automated testing.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project walks through the complete lifecycle of a Dash application:

- Setting up a working Python development environment  
- Processing and cleaning datasets  
- Building an interactive Dash dashboard  
- Enhancing the UI/UX with improved layouts and components  
- Writing unit tests to ensure application reliability  
- Automating tests for continuous integration (Bonus)
